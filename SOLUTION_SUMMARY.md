# AI-RE Project Solution Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the completed implementation for two major requirements:

1. **E2E Test Configuration Migration**: Updated end-to-end tests to use configuration-based approach instead of hard-coded SERVICE_URL
2. **Remote CI/CD Acceptance Testing Design**: Comprehensive technical design for running acceptance tests on remote CI/CD servers

## 1. E2E Test Configuration Migration ✅ COMPLETED

### Problem Statement
The end-to-end tests were using hard-coded `SERVICE_URL` environment variables instead of reading configuration from config files, making them inconsistent with integration tests.

### Solution Implemented

#### 1.1 Configuration Loading Integration
- **Modified Files**: 
  - `tests/e2e/test_api_workflow.py`
  - `tests/e2e/test_input_service_e2e.py` 
  - `tests/e2e/test_service_health.py`

- **Key Changes**:
  - Added `from event_bus_framework.common.config import get_service_config`
  - Replaced `SERVICE_URL` environment variable with configuration-based URL construction
  - Updated all fixtures to use `config` parameter for service configuration
  - Implemented proper Redis URL construction from configuration

#### 1.2 Configuration Pattern Implementation

**Before:**
```python
@pytest.fixture
def api_base_url(self):
    return os.environ.get("SERVICE_URL", "http://localhost:8000")
```

**After:**
```python
@pytest.fixture
def config(self):
    return get_service_config('input_service')

@pytest.fixture
def api_base_url(self, config):
    api_config = config.get('api', {})
    host = api_config.get('host', 'localhost')
    port = api_config.get('port', 8001)
    
    if host == "0.0.0.0":
        host = "localhost"
    
    return f"http://{host}:{port}"
```

#### 1.3 Test Results
- **All E2E tests passing**: 14 passed, 6 skipped (expected for real service tests)
- **Configuration consistency**: Tests now use same configuration loading pattern as integration tests
- **Environment flexibility**: Tests work with different Redis configurations via environment variables

### 1.4 Test Execution Command
```bash
export REDIS_HOST=oslab.online && export REDIS_PORT=7901 && python -m pytest tests/e2e/ -v
```

**Results**: ✅ 14 passed, 6 skipped, 1 warning in 75.10s
